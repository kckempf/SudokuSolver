# SudokuSolver

SudokuSolver is a simple sudoku solver that implements Donald Knuth's Dancing Links algorithm to find the first solution to a given Sudoku puzzle.  It expects a path to a text file with a Sudoku puzzle formatted so that the rows are new lines and blank spaces are represented as X's, and it prints the result to the Console and to a text file of the same format as the input.
